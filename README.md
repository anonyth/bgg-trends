I'm looking for trends and anomalies regarding game mechanics, themes and player configurations that are unusually popular, umambigously dominant, or underserved.

My next level of interest involves games that include a rondel as an action mechanic. Examples are [Trajan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102680/trajan "Trajan") and [Naveagador](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/821949/navegador "Naveagador").

Much gratitude to Jeremy Wickman, whose analysis of [most enjoyable boardgames](https://www.kaggle.com/jeremywickman/what-types-of-board-games-are-the-most-enjoyable) from BoardGameGeek provides the baseline here.
